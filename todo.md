  üìù Placeholder Content & Console Logs

  Development Placeholders

  - Feature Addition Messages:
    - ‚úì Testing suite would be added here
    - ‚úì i18n support would be added here
    - PWA package.json updates would go here

  Interactive Confirmations

  - packages/at3-toolkit/src/migration/runner.ts:86: Interactive confirmation for rollback
  - packages/at3-toolkit/src/migration/runner.ts:88: Backup restoration not implemented

  Configuration Stubs

  - Migration Files: Multiple "Implementation for X migration" stubs in migration/runner.ts:
    - Next.js config migration
    - Tailwind CSS migration
    - Linting config migration
    - TypeScript config migration

  üß™ Test Infrastructure Issues

  Missing Test Files & Mocks

  - All test files were removed (as planned for future sprint)
  - Mock implementations throughout test files (now removed)
  - Integration test setup needs complete rebuild

  Test-Related TODOs

  - Comprehensive test suite rewrite needed
  - Mock fixtures need recreation
  - Integration testing setup required

  üîÑ Migration & Config System

  Incomplete Migration Features

  - File backup/restore system: Not fully implemented
  - Config merging logic: Some edge cases need handling
  - Rollback functionality: Placeholder implementation only
  - Project type detection: Some scenarios not covered

  üöÄ Recommended Action Plan for v0.2.0

  Phase 1: Core CLI Functionality

  1. Implement missing CLI methods in at3-toolkit
  2. Complete feature addition system in at3-stack-kit
  3. Build proper migration/rollback system

  Phase 2: Feature Implementations

  1. Complete i18n setup integration
  2. Finish PWA configuration system
  3. Implement comprehensive testing setup

  Phase 3: Testing & Quality

  1. Rebuild entire test suite from scratch
  2. Add integration tests for all CLI commands
  3. Implement end-to-end testing workflow

  Phase 4: Polish & Documentation

  1. Replace all placeholder console.logs with real functionality
  2. Add proper error handling throughout
  3. Complete missing hooks and utilities

  ‚úÖ Current State Summary

  Ready for v0.1.0-alpha: Yes, as a proof-of-concept with known limitations
  Production Ready: No, significant functionality is stubbed out
  Next Priority: Complete core CLI implementations and feature systems

  The codebase is in excellent shape for an alpha release, with solid architecture and build systems in place. The TODOs are
  clearly marked and represent the natural next phase of development rather than blocking issues.
